Here we make a test, in which robot's wheel velocity is changed depending on the button press
    
    Button 1: Move Forward
    Button 2: Move Backward
    Button 3: Turn Left
    Button 4: Turn Right
    Button 5: Stop

The velocities to make change in robots behavior are hard coded in the Controller code. So, please change from there.

The Controller code also receives the values for positions of different axis. The 2-Axis Joystick provides a simple and convenient way to add X-Y control to a project.
